    "I looked at this data to see how Heathrow activity was growing; had the new terminal increased passenger numbers and was there evidence that flight or passenger numbers had reached a peak supporting the argument that it required a new runway?  There was also a second investigation which was to identify the impact of some major disruptions on Heathrow activity.\n",
