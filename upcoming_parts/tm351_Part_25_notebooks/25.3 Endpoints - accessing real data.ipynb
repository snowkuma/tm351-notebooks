However, they vary in the helpfulness of error reporting should a website be unavailable. You may come across error messages such as 'Error 400: Failed to load URL http://dbpedia.org/' which probably means that one of the websites mentioned in a query is unavailable (perhaps because it is being updated).

Also, it is to be hoped that the names used for the predicates provide a clue as to their meaning.\n",
